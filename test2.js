// Ben is starving and he wants to get some food to eat as quickly as possible. Help him determine the shortest path to get the food. Ben's location is represented by '*' and there is only one '*' location. The food is presented by '#' and there may be multiple food locations. Areas with 'X' represent the space you cannot pass through. Areas with 'O' (the letter O) represent the space you can walk through.

// Output the length of the shortest path to food. If no food is available, return -1.

// Example 1:
//
// Input:
// XXXXXX
// X*OOOX
// XOO#OX
// XXXXXX
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There is only one path to get the food.
//
//
// Example 2:
//
// Input:
// XXXXX
// X*XOX
// XOX#X
// XXXXX
// Output: -1
// Explanation: We cannot find a path to get the food.
//
//
// Note: Both width and height of the given map will not exceed 200.
